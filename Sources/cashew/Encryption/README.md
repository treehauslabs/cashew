# Encryption

Optional, path-based encryption for content-addressable data structures.

## Why Encryption?

Cashew's content-addressable headers store data as Merkle trees: each node is serialized, hashed, and referenced by its CID. This is powerful for integrity verification and deduplication, but it means anyone with access to the store can read every value.

Encryption solves this by letting you selectively encrypt parts of the tree while keeping others public. The CID becomes a hash of the *ciphertext* rather than the plaintext, so the content-addressing guarantee still holds — you just can't read the content without the key.

This is useful when:

- **Shared storage, private data.** Multiple parties share a content-addressable store, but each party's data should only be readable by holders of that party's key.
- **Selective disclosure.** Some fields in a record are public (e.g., a username), while others are private (e.g., an email). You can encrypt only the private fields.
- **Key rotation per subtree.** Different branches of a tree can use different keys, enabling per-user or per-tenant encryption within a single data structure.
- **Auditability without readability.** An auditor can verify that the tree structure is intact (CIDs still chain correctly) without being able to decrypt the values.

## How It Works

### Content Addressing With Encryption

Without encryption:
```
CID = SHA-256(serialize(node))
```

With encryption:
```
CID = SHA-256(AES-GCM(serialize(node), key, iv))
```

The header carries `EncryptionInfo` metadata — a hash of the key used (`keyHash`) and the initialization vector (`iv`). This metadata is enough to look up the correct key and decrypt the data later. The key itself is never stored in the header.

### The Encrypt-Store-Resolve Cycle

```
              encrypt                  store                     resolve
  plaintext  -------->  encrypted   --------->   store    <---------  encrypted
  header      (key)     header       (storer +    (CID →    (fetcher +  header
                        + EncryptionInfo  KeyProvider) data)  KeyProvider)
                                                                  |
                                                                  v
                                                             plaintext
                                                             header
```

1. **Encrypt**: Apply an `ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>` to a header tree. Each matching path gets encrypted with AES-GCM using a random IV. The CID changes to reflect the ciphertext.

2. **Store**: Call `storeRecursively(storer:)`. The storer must conform to `KeyProvider` so it can look up the key by hash. The header's stored IV is reused to deterministically reproduce the same ciphertext, ensuring the data's hash matches the CID.

3. **Resolve**: Fetch data by CID. The fetcher (conforming to `KeyProvidingFetcher`) provides the decryption key. `decryptIfNeeded` transparently decrypts before deserialization.

## Basic Usage

### Encrypting a Single Header

```swift
import Crypto

let key = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)
let scalar = MyScalar(value: 42)

// Plaintext header: CID is hash of serialized scalar
let plainHeader = HeaderImpl(node: scalar)

// Encrypted header: CID is hash of encrypted serialized scalar
let encHeader = try HeaderImpl(node: scalar, key: key)

// The encrypted header carries metadata for decryption
encHeader.encryptionInfo?.keyHash  // base64(SHA256(key))
encHeader.encryptionInfo?.iv       // base64(random nonce)
```

### Storing and Resolving Encrypted Data

The storer and fetcher must be able to look up keys by their hash. Implement `KeyProvider` (for storers) or `KeyProvidingFetcher` (for fetchers that also provide keys):

```swift
class MyStoreFetcher: Storer, Fetcher, KeyProvider {
    private var storage: [String: Data] = [:]
    private var keys: [String: SymmetricKey] = [:]

    func registerKey(_ key: SymmetricKey) {
        let keyData = key.withUnsafeBytes { Data($0) }
        let hash = Data(SHA256.hash(data: keyData)).base64EncodedString()
        keys[hash] = key
    }

    func key(for keyHash: String) -> SymmetricKey? { keys[keyHash] }
    func store(rawCid: String, data: Data) { storage[rawCid] = data }
    func fetch(rawCid: String) async throws -> Data {
        guard let data = storage[rawCid] else { throw MyError.notFound }
        return data
    }
}
```

Store and resolve:

```swift
let fetcher = MyStoreFetcher()
fetcher.registerKey(key)

// Store encrypted header
let encHeader = try HeaderImpl(node: scalar, key: key)
try encHeader.storeRecursively(storer: fetcher)

// Resolve from just the CID + encryption metadata
let cidOnly = HeaderImpl<MyScalar>(
    rawCID: encHeader.rawCID,
    node: nil,
    encryptionInfo: encHeader.encryptionInfo
)
let resolved = try await cidOnly.resolve(fetcher: fetcher)
resolved.node!  // decrypted scalar
```

### Path-Based Encryption on a MerkleDictionary

Instead of encrypting the entire tree, encrypt specific paths:

```swift
var dict = MerkleDictionaryImpl<HeaderImpl<MyScalar>>()
dict = try dict.inserting(key: "public-field", value: HeaderImpl(node: MyScalar(value: 1)))
dict = try dict.inserting(key: "secret-field", value: HeaderImpl(node: MyScalar(value: 2)))
let header = HeaderImpl(node: dict)

// Only encrypt the value at "secret-field"
var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set(["secret-field"], value: .targeted(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// "public-field" is still readable without any key
let publicVal = try encrypted.node!.get(key: "public-field")!
publicVal.encryptionInfo  // nil — plaintext

// "secret-field" requires the key to read
let secretVal = try encrypted.node!.get(key: "secret-field")!
secretVal.encryptionInfo  // non-nil — encrypted
```

### Serialization Format

Encrypted headers serialize to a string that preserves the encryption metadata:

```swift
let enc = try HeaderImpl(node: scalar, key: key)
enc.description
// "enc:abc123...==:def456...==:baguqeer..."
//       keyHash       iv        rawCID

// Round-trips through LosslessStringConvertible
let restored = HeaderImpl<MyScalar>(enc.description)!
restored.rawCID == enc.rawCID            // true
restored.encryptionInfo == enc.encryptionInfo  // true
```

Plaintext headers serialize as before — just the bare CID string.

## Encryption Strategies

Strategies are specified via `ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>`, where paths in the trie map to parts of the Merkle dictionary's key space.

### targeted(key)

Encrypts the **trie structure** (RadixHeaders) and the **values** at specifically targeted sub-paths. When applied at the root (`[""]`), the entire trie is encrypted — you cannot enumerate keys without the key. Values are only encrypted if a sub-path override targets them.

When applied at a specific path (e.g., `["alice"]`), only the value at that path is encrypted; the trie structure leading to it stays plaintext.

```swift
// Root targeted: encrypts trie structure, values stay plaintext
var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .targeted(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// You CANNOT see what keys exist without the key
// After decrypting the trie, values are plaintext CIDs

// Path-specific targeted: encrypts only the value at that path
var encryption2 = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption2.set(["alice"], value: .targeted(key))
let encrypted2 = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption2)

// You CAN see that "alice" exists as a key
// You CANNOT read the value at "alice" without the key
// "bob" (if it exists) is completely unaffected
```

**Use case**: Encrypt the trie structure while selectively encrypting specific values. Like encrypting a database's row index while also encrypting the "ssn" column but leaving "name" readable.

### list(key)

Encrypts the **trie structure** (RadixHeaders). You cannot enumerate keys or navigate the trie without decrypting first. Values at each key remain as plaintext CIDs.

```swift
var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .list(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// You CANNOT see what keys exist without the key
// After decrypting the trie structure, values are plaintext CIDs
```

**Use case**: Hide the set of keys in a dictionary. An observer can't tell what entries exist, but once they have the key, the values themselves don't need further decryption.

### recursive(key)

Encrypts **everything** — both the trie structure and all values — with the same key. This is the most private option. Nothing is readable without the key.

```swift
var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .recursive(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// Nothing is readable without the key
// Every header in the tree has encryptionInfo set
```

**Use case**: Full privacy for an entire subtree.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Mixed Keys With Recursive Overrides

Recursive encryption propagates a key to all descendants, but longer-path entries override shorter ones. This lets you use different keys for different branches of the same tree:

```swift
let teamKey = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)
let aliceKey = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)

var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .recursive(teamKey))        // default: everything
encryption.set(["alice"], value: .recursive(aliceKey))   // override: alice's subtree

let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// "bob" and all other keys use teamKey
// "alice" and all her descendants use aliceKey
```

You can also mix strategies at different levels:

```swift
encryption.set([""], value: .recursive(teamKey))
encryption.set(["public-index"], value: .targeted(teamKey))
// "public-index" keeps its trie structure visible but encrypts its value
// Everything else is fully encrypted with teamKey
```

### Preserving Encryption Through Transforms

When you transform an encrypted tree (insert, delete, update keys), encryption is preserved automatically if you supply a `KeyProvider`:

```swift
let fetcher = MyKeyProvidingStoreFetcher()
fetcher.registerKey(key)

// Start with an encrypted tree
var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .recursive(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// Delete a key — remaining headers stay encrypted
var transforms = ArrayTrie<Transform>()
transforms.set(["alice"], value: .delete)
let result = try encrypted.transform(transforms: transforms, keyProvider: fetcher)

// result is still encrypted with the same key (new IV, new CID)
result!.encryptionInfo!.keyHash == encrypted.encryptionInfo!.keyHash  // true
result!.rawCID != encrypted.rawCID  // true — content changed
```

The rules for encryption preservation through transforms:

| Transform | Encryption behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Delete** (value removed) | Header is gone — nothing to preserve |
| **Delete** (trie restructured) | Surviving headers keep their encryption |
| **Update** | Header re-encrypted with same key, new IV |
| **Insert** | New header is **not** auto-encrypted |
| **No keyProvider** | Encryption is stripped (backward compatible) |

Inserted values are not auto-encrypted because the framework can't know which key to use. To encrypt newly inserted content, use the combined transform+encrypt overload:

```swift
let result = try header.transform(
    transforms: transforms,
    encryption: encryption,
    keyProvider: fetcher
)
// Transforms are applied first (preserving existing encryption),
// then the encryption trie is applied to encrypt new content
```

### Transform + Store + Resolve Round-Trip

A full lifecycle with encryption:

```swift
// 1. Build and encrypt
var dict = MerkleDictionaryImpl<HeaderImpl<MyScalar>>()
dict = try dict.inserting(key: "alice", value: HeaderImpl(node: MyScalar(value: 1)))
dict = try dict.inserting(key: "bob", value: HeaderImpl(node: MyScalar(value: 2)))
let header = HeaderImpl(node: dict)

var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set([""], value: .recursive(key))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// 2. Transform (delete alice, encryption preserved on bob)
var transforms = ArrayTrie<Transform>()
transforms.set(["alice"], value: .delete)
let transformed = try encrypted.transform(transforms: transforms, keyProvider: fetcher)!

// 3. Store
try transformed.storeRecursively(storer: fetcher)

// 4. Resolve
let resolved = try await transformed.removingNode().resolveRecursive(fetcher: fetcher)
let bob = try await resolved.node!.get(key: "bob")!.resolve(fetcher: fetcher)
bob.node!  // MyScalar(value: 2)
```

### Sibling Paths With Different Keys

Different keys can protect different paths at the same level:

```swift
let aliceKey = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)
let bobKey = SymmetricKey(size: .bits256)

var encryption = ArrayTrie<EncryptionStrategy>()
encryption.set(["alice"], value: .targeted(aliceKey))
encryption.set(["bob"], value: .targeted(bobKey))
let encrypted = try header.encrypt(encryption: encryption)

// A holder of aliceKey can read alice but not bob
// A holder of bobKey can read bob but not alice
// A holder of neither key can still see that alice and bob exist (targeted)
```

### Encryption-Aware Direct Dictionary Operations

The direct `mutating` and `deleting` methods on `MerkleDictionary` also accept a `keyProvider` to preserve encryption on affected RadixHeaders:

```swift
let mutated = try encryptedDict.mutating(
    key: "alice",
    value: HeaderImpl(node: MyScalar(value: 99)),
    keyProvider: fetcher
)
// RadixHeaders that were encrypted remain encrypted

let deleted = try encryptedDict.deleting(key: "alice", keyProvider: fetcher)
// Remaining RadixHeaders preserve their encryption
```

---

## Key Management

### The KeyProvider Protocol

All encryption operations that need to look up a key use the `KeyProvider` protocol:

```swift
public protocol KeyProvider {
    func key(for keyHash: String) -> SymmetricKey?
}
```

The `keyHash` is `base64(SHA256(raw_key_bytes))`. This is a one-way derivation — the hash is safe to store alongside encrypted data because you can't recover the key from it.

### KeyProvidingFetcher

For resolve operations, the fetcher must also provide keys:

```swift
public protocol KeyProvidingFetcher: Fetcher, KeyProvider {}
```

A single type can conform to both `Storer` and `KeyProvidingFetcher` to handle the full lifecycle.

### When Keys Are Needed

| Operation | Requires KeyProvider? | Which protocol? |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `encrypt(encryption:)` | No — keys are in the strategy | N/A |
| `storeRecursively(storer:)` | Yes, if header is encrypted | `storer as? KeyProvider` |
| `resolve(fetcher:)` | Yes, if header is encrypted | `fetcher as? KeyProvider` |
| `transform(transforms:keyProvider:)` | Yes, to preserve encryption | `KeyProvider` parameter |
| `init(node:key:)` | No — key is passed directly | N/A |

---

## Design Notes

### Random IVs and CID Non-Determinism

Each encryption generates a random initialization vector via `AES.GCM.Nonce()`. This means encrypting the same plaintext with the same key twice produces different ciphertexts and therefore different CIDs. This is intentional:

- It prevents an attacker from detecting when two encrypted headers contain the same plaintext.
- It provides forward secrecy — re-encrypting produces a new, unlinkable CID.

The trade-off is that you cannot compare CIDs to check if two encrypted headers contain the same data.

### Deterministic Re-Encryption at Store Time

When `storeRecursively` is called, the header doesn't cache its encrypted bytes. Instead, it re-encrypts the node using the IV stored in `encryptionInfo`. Because AES-GCM is deterministic given the same (key, nonce, plaintext) triple, this produces identical ciphertext, and the resulting hash matches the header's CID.

This avoids storing encrypted data in the header object, keeping the header lightweight.

### No Automatic Encryption on Insert

When a new value is inserted into an encrypted dictionary (via `.insert` transform or `inserting(key:value:)`), the new header is **not** automatically encrypted. This is because:

1. The framework doesn't know which key to use for new entries.
2. The inserted value may already carry its own encryption from its serialized description.
3. Automatic encryption could cause surprising behavior with key management.

To encrypt new inserts, use `transform(transforms:encryption:keyProvider:)` which applies the encryption trie after transforms.

### Error Handling

Encryption operations surface errors through `DataErrors`:

| Error | When |
|-------|------|
| `encryptionFailed` | AES-GCM seal produced no combined output |
| `keyNotFound` | `KeyProvider` returned nil, or storer/fetcher doesn't conform to `KeyProvider` |
| `invalidIV` | `EncryptionInfo.iv` is not valid base64 |
| `nodeNotAvailable` | Tried to encrypt/transform a header with no loaded node |
